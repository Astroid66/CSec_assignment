To be frank, I had just used github only once before and I wasn't so familiar with it. But this task 1 helped me a lot in exploring Github more in a very interesting way. 

First of all, I went to find the first flag of the task, which was finding the all the branches of the current repository. Which I found in the drop down menu under the name of the repository.
Then the last flag to be found was commit to the branch. That clearly above the write up, in the commit "coomit".

Then the third flag was to find the forks of the repository. So in order to find the forks I actually forked the repository ;).Then I found out the forks of the repository in the insights section
below the name of the repository. And then I completed the last flag of the task which was to automate tasks on github.
