To be frank, I had just used github only once before and I wasn't so familiar with it. But this task helped me a lot in exploring Github more, in a very interesting way. 

First of all, I went to find the first part of flag, in the file it was written that the first part of is the type og hash used for git.the hash is computed by "SHA-1" algorithm. Then we have to navigate
thruogh the commits of the file.
In the commit "coomit", it was written that the second part of the flag is the default name of the branch name given by github for a new repository. So as of now the default name
given to new branch is 'main'.

Then the third flag was to find the forks of the repository.Then I found out the forks of the repository in the insights section below the name of the repository. So. it said that
the last part of the flag is the mechanism to automate tasks on github. So exactly I wasn't able to find a single word for the mechanism but I found the tools which are used to 
automate things, which is "CI/CD".

So in my view, the three parts of the flag are:
1.SHA-1
2.main
3.CI/CD
